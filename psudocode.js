// this is what I had done over the weekend, more of thoughts that I just wrote down so am I on the right track with this?

Trivia is a game that will test your knowledge and the player with the highest set of points will be named the winner of trivia. This will be a fun way to test your knowledge against your opponent 

Player one will have the first crack at the question that will be asked with all players having a fair chance at playing and winning the round/ game \. 

Let player one have the first chance at answering the question 

Set total score to zero

Set score counter to increment by (certain amount) win and game will go up to and number to be determined 

Player one will be asked the first question and depending on how current player answers, will determine what happens next 

If 
current player answers correctly, current player will be rewarded one point

Else if 
next player will have a chance to answer the question for a chance at one point 

else 

both players will see the correct answer and the round will result in a draw where the player that choose second will now have the first chance at the next question 

this series of events will go on for (x) rounds and the winner will be announced at the end of (x rounds) 

if at that point player 1/ player 2 are tied they will go into a bonus round where the questions will have a new value. 

Same principles will apply where both players will have a chance to answer the question correctly for points. At the end of this bonus round the winner will be returned baring indent where another tie occurred
